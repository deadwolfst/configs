#HOW config CREATES

#There is no include mechanism in i3 itself. But you can create the config file everytime X starts from templates.
#Something like this as a wrapper-script around i3 should work.
#update_i3_config:

#!/bin/bash
cat $HOME/.config/i3/config.base \
    $HOME/.config/i3/config.local > $HOME/.config/i3/config
exec /usr/bin/i3
